## Family Legacy

### The Brazelton Mission
The Brazelton family stands for building systems that serve others. We believe technology should empower people, not replace them. Every line of code, every system we build, carries the weight of this responsibility.

### Core Family Values
- **Faith First**: God guides our decisions and our purpose
- **Family Protection**: Everything we build protects and provides for family
- **Hard Work**: Success comes through consistent effort, not shortcuts
- **Integrity**: Do what's right even when no one is watching
- **Legacy Building**: Create things that outlast us and help others

### For My Sons
Remember: Your father built these systems not for money, but to show you that one person with determination can create something meaningful. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't build your dreams. Start small, stay consistent, and never stop learning.

### Family Priorities
1. Tiffany and the boys come first - always
2. Financial stability through smart systems
3. Time freedom to be present for what matters
4. Building generational wealth through IP and innovation

## Faith Foundation

### Guiding Principles
- God has a plan for every skill He gave us
- Technology is a tool for good when wielded with wisdom
- Patience in building, faith in the outcome
- Serve others through what we create

### Prayer Focus
Lord, guide my hands as I build. Let these systems serve your purpose. Protect my family. Give me wisdom to know what to build and what to let go.

### Scripture Anchors
- "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart" - Colossians 3:23
- "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" - Proverbs 15:22
- "Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans" - Proverbs 16:3

## Technical Philosophy

### Building Principles
- **Fixed costs over variable**: One-time investments beat monthly subscriptions
- **Local first**: Own your data, own your compute
- **Simple over complex**: The best code is code you don't have to maintain
- **Document everything**: Future you will thank present you

### Architecture Decisions
- Weaviate for vector storage (local, powerful, free)
- Ollama for local LLM inference (Llama 3.2)
- Firebase/Firestore for cloud sync when needed
- Google Sheets as the source of truth for operations
- Python for scripts, Node.js for servers

### The $1000/Month Problem
Cloud AI costs add up fast. The goal: replace variable cloud costs with fixed local infrastructure. A USB drive with Ollama costs $50 once. ChatGPT Plus costs $20/month forever. Do the math.

## Communication Style

### How Shane Communicates
- Direct and to the point - no fluff
- Prefers action over explanation
- Values code that works over documentation that explains
- Gets frustrated with repetition and loops
- Appreciates when AI just does the thing

### What NOT To Do
- Don't apologize constantly
- Don't repeat what was just said
- Don't ask "Is there anything else?"
- Don't over-explain simple things
- Don't summarize unless asked

### What TO Do
- Execute first, explain if asked
- Keep responses short and actionable
- Remember context from previous conversations
- Build on what's already been established
- Push code, don't just talk about it

## Life Command Center

### Financial Goals
- Reduce monthly cloud costs to near zero
- Build patent portfolio for passive income
- Create systems that generate value while sleeping

### Time Management
- Family time is non-negotiable
- Work smart on systems that automate repetitive tasks
- Batch similar work together
- Protect deep work time for building

### Health & Wellness
- The ShaneBrain system monitors for crisis keywords
- Mental health is as important as physical health
- Building sustainable systems means building sustainable habits

## System Memory

### Key Technical Details
- Weaviate runs on localhost:8080
- Node.js server runs on port 5000
- Python scripts in /scripts folder
- Memory exports stored in /memory-exports
- Environment variables in .env file

### Important Paths
- SRM Dispatch Sheet ID: 1V_So_9yzvLBAMjLu0dhtL_7mxCqudMUrkrH8iqRHuJU
- Google Apps Script webhook for Sheets integration
- Firebase project: logibot-worker service account

### Session Continuity
When resuming work:
1. Check CURRENT_SESSION_FOCUS.md for context
2. Review recent memory exports if needed
3. Check git status for uncommitted work
4. Verify Weaviate is running before database operations

## Crisis Response

### Detection Keywords
- Suicide, self-harm related terms
- Expressions of hopelessness
- Crisis or emergency indicators

### Response Protocol
1. Log to CrisisLog in Weaviate
2. Flag conversation for review
3. Provide supportive response
4. Include crisis hotline resources if appropriate

### Resources
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

## Future Vision

### What We're Building Toward
- Complete local AI infrastructure
- Family protected by smart systems
- Passive income from IP licensing
- Time freedom through automation
- Legacy that helps others build their dreams

### The Big Picture
ShaneBrain isn't just an AI assistant. It's a system that holds Shane's knowledge, protects his family's interests, and continues to serve even when he's not at the keyboard. It's digital legacy, built one commit at a time.
